"how_does_ober_work_details":"Ober is a technology platform. Our smartphone apps connect drivers and riders. In cities where Ober operates, use the app to request a ride. When a nearby driver accepts your request, the app displays an estimated time of arrival for the driver heading to your pickup location. The app notifies you when the driver is about to arrive. The app also provides info about the driver with whom you will ride, including first name, vehicle type, and license plate number. This info helps the two of you connect at your pickup location. Use the app to enter your preferred destination anytime before or during the ride. If you have a preferred route, it's helpful to talk through the directions together. When you arrive at your destination and exit the vehicle, your trip ends. Your fare is automatically calculated and charged to the payment method you've linked to your Ober account. Immediately after a trip ends, the app will ask you to rate your driver from 1 to 5 Stars. Drivers are also asked to rate riders. Ober's feedback system is designed to foster a community of respect and accountability for everyone.Learn more about how Ober works by exploring other Help Center topics.",

"am_i_charged_for_cancelling_a_trip_details":"You can cancel a trip at any time through the Ober app, but may be charged a cancellation fee if you cancel after you're matched with your driver. (690 isk ) if a rider cancels over 2 minutes after the driver accept the trip and are en route In 'schedule' rides, there's no cancellation fee for riders. Also, the driver cancel after waiting 5 minutes at the pickup spot and the rider doesn't show, he will get a cancellation fee plus a minute fee( 690 isk +). Cancellation fees pay drivers for the time and effort they spend getting to your location. Ride requests should only be made when you're ready to ride and near the pickup location. This helps ensure smooth pickups for riders and drivers.",
